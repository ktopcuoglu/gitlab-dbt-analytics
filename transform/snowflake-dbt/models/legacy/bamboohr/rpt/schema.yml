The sum of the weights are divided by the total number of active team members to create this KPI. We only care about the state of this number on the last day of a calendar month. This model is used for reporting purposes and is broken out by division, department, and company by filtering on breakout_type to get to the grain needed. THIS MODEL SHOULD NOT BE CONSUMED FOR ANY ANALYSIS PRIOR TO SEPTERMBER 2019 and between May - September 2020.
